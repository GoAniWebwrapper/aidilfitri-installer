# Wrapper: Offline (Revision) - Installer

## What is Wrapper: Offline (Revision)?
After the dreaded, unstable 1.3.0 release of Wrapper: Offline, Wrapper: Offline (Revision) was created. (simply called "Revision" for the rest of this page) Unlike the original Wrapper: Offline, Revision focuses on simplicity and *stability* while also providing users a pleasant experience. Revision will continue to get updates in the future.

## Running / Installation
To start the installer on Windows, open install_wrapper.bat. It'll automate just about everything for you and, well, install Wrapper: Offline (Revision). On your first run, you will likely need to right-click it and click "Run as Administrator". This allows it to properly install what it needs to run. After your initial run, you shouldn't need to do that again, you can start it as normal.

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper: Offline (Revision).***
